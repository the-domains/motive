An interactive sonic visual art installation in Times Square celebrating Earth Month, April 1-30, 2016 in collaboration with a Voice for Nature. Featuring Amazon Rainforest Sound Environments Recorded by Francisco López.

As part of the Times Square Arts' At the Crossroads program, which includes installations and performances on the public plazas of Times Square, visitors will be invited to take self-guided audio tours of the Amazon by downloading the JUNGLE-IZED mobile app. From noon to midnight throughout April visitors can also borrow a pair of premium Audio-Technica headphones from the official JUNGLE-IZED kiosk located on 7th Avenue between 43rd and 44th Street, to begin the journey through a virtual soundscape that superimposes the Amazon ecosystem upon a 8-square block area of Times Square, by following the 73rd line of longitude West that connects Times Square with the Amazon rainforest.

Available through the JUNGLE-IZED mobile app, the virtual soundscape is composed by Soundwalk Collective and features Amazon rainforest sound environments recorded by internationally acclaimed sound artist Francisco López.

As visitors walk throughout Times Square, the voices of Shipibo shamans and narration by Amazon experts Jeremy Narby and Daniel Pinchbeck will guide them along a jungle tour and into a conversation with nature. The use of Audio-Technica headphones provides an end-to-end experience and ensures that none of the Amazon's auditory brilliance is lost along the way.
