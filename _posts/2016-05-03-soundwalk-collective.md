April 1-30, 2016 Soundwalk Collective will present JUNGLE-IZED: a month-long interactive multi-sensory art installation that will transform Times Square, transporting over half a million visitors daily to the heart of the Amazon, by following the 73rd Meridian West that connects Times Square with the Amazon rainforest.

Presented in partnership with The Times Square Advertising Coalition (TSAC), Times Square Arts, Audio-Technica, The Lost Explorer and CXA+ART, this immersive installation includes a participatory audio experience and an interactive video not only to encourage and celebrate a conversation with nature but to bring a heightened awareness around climate change and the environmental impact of our everyday actions.
